# SQL_PROJECT-Online-Book-Store-
Project Overview : 
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete SQL database system for an Online Bookstore. It includes creating relational tables, importing data from CSV files, and performing analytical SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights.
The project is ideal for showcasing SQL skills such as schema design, joins, grouping, data import, and reporting.

Database Structure

The system contains three main tables:

🔹 Books

Stores book information such as:

Title

Author

Genre

Published Year

Price

Stock

🔹 Customers

Contains customer details:

Name

Email

Phone

City

Country

🔹 Orders

Tracks all purchases:

Customer ID (Foreign Key)

Book ID (Foreign Key)

Order Date

Quantity

Total Amount

Primary and foreign keys ensure data consistency and clean relationships between tables.







The dataset was manually uploaded using CSV files for:

Books

Customers

Orders

This approach helped ensure correct column mapping and clean data import.
